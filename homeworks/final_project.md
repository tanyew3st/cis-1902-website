CIS 1902: Python Programming
Final Project
Due April 30th at 11:59 PM

Description
The moment you have been waiting for: the final project. Create whatever you want to build; I hope by now you can see that you can do anything in Python! You are allowed to work with a partner if you would like to. You should build something you will be proud of - we encourage you to build something you can show off! Feel free to discuss project ideas with the instructor or TAs at office hours. The project is intended to be very open-ended. By this point, you should have a sense of what difficulty we may expect, and we will give you feedback as we see fit. 

As a side note - if you have some radical idea for a project and are not sure how to do it, we have a lot of experience and can help you with it. Lots of things may be easier to implement than you think and we can help you create a reasonably-sized project.

Example Projects:
- The sentiment analysis project from the homework (Yelp reviews)
- A sports betting model for the NBA
- A complex game with a GUI (like Blackjack, Chess, Poker, etc.)
- A web scraper that collects data from a website and uses it to do some useful analysis (e.g. stock prices)
- A machine learning model that predicts something (e.g. housing prices, weather, etc.)
- A chatbot that interacts with users and provides information or assistance


Final Project Submission Requirements (just general guidelines, not a rubric, and flexible to your project):
- One new class definition 
- One use of an internal Python library: things you don't have to pip install. (e.g. random, datetime, etc.)
- One use of an external Python library: things you have to pip install. (e.g. Hugging Face, pandas, etc.)
- Testing and typing of the code as you see fit. You are not required to test every part of your code, but you should test the parts that are most likely to break.
- In-line documentation (i.e., comments in code)
- README.md (installation instructions, code structure)
- A 3-5 minute video presentation of your project. This should be a demo of your project, and you should explain what you built, how you built it, and what you learned from the project.

Milestone 1: The Proposal (10%)

The proposal is due April 16th at 11:59 PM. We encourage you to submit it earlier. We will provide feedback within a couple days of when you submit it. The proposal should be a markdown/PDF document that includes the following:

- Project title
- Project partners or if you are working alone
- Project description / summary / overall goals 
- Use case: what problem are you solving, and how will your project solve it?
- Project architecture: what classes will you have, what libraries will you use, what data will you use? How will you ensure that your code is modular and reusable?
- Testing: how will you test your code? What are the edge cases you will consider?
- Timeline: what are the milestones you will hit? This is more for you to keep track of your progress, but it will also help us understand how you are progressing, and how we can help you achieve your goals by the end of the semester.

These are all intended to be rough, and you are more than welcome to change your project as you go along. We just want to make sure you are thinking about the project in a structured way.

Final Submission: 

Your main deliverables outside of the guidelines will be to submit the codebase for a review and to submit a video presentation of your project. The codebase should be submitted as a zip file and your video should be uploaded to Gradescope. We will grade these together to make up the remainder of the points on the assignment.
