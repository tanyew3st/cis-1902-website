Collaboration is NOT permitted.

This homework involves implementing a trie, a tree-like data structure that 
stores a set of strings. Tries allow for efficient searching of a string 
within a set and have applications in spell checking and autocomplete.

You might wonder why use a Trie instead of a hash table or a balanced binary 
search tree. While hash tables offer O(1) expected time complexity for 
searching and balanced binary search trees offer O(log n), they aren't 
efficient for prefix-based searches. Tries excel in searching strings with a 
given prefix and listing all such strings in lexicographic order. Moreover, 
tries are more space-efficient compared to hash tables, which face collision 
issues as they grow, and binary search trees, which have significant 
overhead due to pointers and rebalancing.

Formally, with an alphabet A (a set of valid characters) and a set of strings 
S (where no string is a prefix of another), a trie is an ordered tree. Each 
node (except the root) is labeled with a character from A, and the tree has 
|S| leaves, one for each string. The trie is structured so that the 
concatenation of characters from the root to a leaf forms a string in S.

For example:
Given A as the English alphabet and S={bet, bid, bit, set, step}:

First, suppose we insert bet & bid into the trie. The trie would look like this:

-- Tree Structure -- 
Root
 ├── b
 │    ├── e
 │    │    └── t
 │    └── i
 │         └── d

After all of the words are inserted, the trie would look like this:

-- Tree Structure --
Root
 ├── b
 │    ├── e
 │    │    └── t
 │    └── i
 │         ├── d
 │         └── t
 └── s
      ├── e
      │    └── t
      └── t
           ├── e
           └── p

In this homework, you will implement a trie and its operations. Unique to 
this implementation, you must account for multiple insertions of the same 
word. This requires tracking the count of each word in the trie.

In the functions below, the 'NotImplementedError' exception is initially raised. 
This is a placeholder to indicate that the function is incomplete. When you 
write your code for each function, you will replace this exception with your 
implementation.

Your primary goal is to complete the assignment correctly, focusing on a 
thorough understanding of trie operations and structure. While maintaining 
clean and optimized code is encouraged, it is not the main emphasis. 
Completing the tasks accurately and understanding the concepts take precedence. 
Remember, while well-optimized code is a great skill, the primary objective 
here is to learn and correctly implement the trie data structure. Assume that 
all the inputs are valid - so everything is some form of string, even if empty.
Definately think about how you want to handle different cases in the code. As always,
come to office hours or post on Ed if you need help!

Good luck!
